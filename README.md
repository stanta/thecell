## Building (biological) cell model as a software code

Some time ago I got follow insight.
Let's imagine that cell is computer. It has a lot of components: nucleus, vacuoles, mitochondria etc. 
It programmed by DNA and RNA.
DNA/RNAs have basic dictionary: nucleobases—adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), thymine (T), and uracil (U)— it looks like a compiled code.
(Viruses have boot sector, really).
DNAs transcribes by RNA polymerase - it works like CPU (better analog - Turing machine) and goes step-by-step via DNA consequence.

I believe that we can come to better understanding of the in-cell process this way.

So, I'll start to describe this in Python... Let's try

If you know about same projects or have any useful information - I'll be grateful for this!
